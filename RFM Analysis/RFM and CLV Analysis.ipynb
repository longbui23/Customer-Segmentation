Hence, it is important to divide customers into specific groups based on certain factors. The task is to find those factors and categorize customers into specific groups\n","\n","    \n","Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a company's customers into different groups or segments based on different customer attributes. The process of customer segmentation is based on finding differences between customer behavior or characteristics.\n","\n","The main goals and benefits of customer segmentation:\n","\n","* **Increasing revenue:** This is the most obvious goal of any customer segmentation task\n","* **Understanding customers:** One of the business models that is increasingly popular is “know your customer - KYC”, segmenting customers will help a lot for this model.\n","* **Marketing:** The most obvious benefit of customer segmentation is the ability to effectively focus marketing efforts. If a company knows the different segments of its customer base, it can come up with better marketing campaigns tailored specifically for that segment. A good segmentation model allows for a better understanding of customer requirements and thus increases the chances of success of any marketing campaign developed by the organization.\n","\n","* **Place the Right Product** A good customer segmentation strategy can also help a company develop or offer new products, or a group of products together as a form of offering combine.\n","* **Find potential customer segments:** Find customer segments that may be missing to identify untapped customer segments by focusing on marketing campaigns or business development new.\n","\n","### Summary\n","\n","\n","#### 1. RFM model represents customer value:\n","\n","Since our dataset is limited to sales history and does not include anonymized information about customers, we will use an RFM-based model. The RFM model takes a customer's transactions and computes three important information properties about each customer:\n","* **Recency**: The value of how recently a customer made a purchase\n","* **Frequency**: Frequency of customer transactions\n","* **Monetary value**: The amount (or pounds in ASM post) of all the transactions that the customer has made\n","\n","#### 2. Clustering:\n","The most obvious method to perform customer segmentation is to use unsupervised Machine Learning methods like clustering. The simplest method is to collect as much data about the customer as possible in the form of features or attributes and then find the different clusters that can be obtained from that data. Finally, we can find out the characteristics of customer segments by analyzing the characteristics of the clusters.\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"39234ce8","metadata":{"id":"39234ce8"},"source":["## II.
